            The primary types of cloud computing services are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtualized computing resources, PaaS allows for building applications without managing underlying infrastructure, and SaaS offers software solutions through a subscription model.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The major deployment models in cloud computing include public, private, and hybrid clouds. Public clouds are hosted by third-party providers and offer services to the general public, while private clouds are dedicated to a single organization. Hybrid clouds combine both, providing flexibility and scalability.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Cloud computing offers significant advantages such as cost savings, scalability, flexibility, and the ability to access services from anywhere. However, concerns about data security, privacy, and compliance remain key challenges for businesses considering cloud adoption.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Major cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, each offering a wide range of services to meet diverse business needs. Cloud computing continues to evolve, with innovations such as edge computing and serverless architecture driving further growth.

        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="post-summary">
            
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that allows you to securely control access to AWS resources, enabling you to define who can access specific resources, what actions they can perform, and under which conditions, ensuring robust security and compliance.</p>

        <div class="full-content" hidden>
          <p>
            IAM enables you to define fine-grained access to AWS resources using policies. Policies are written in JSON and specify the permissions granted to users, groups, or roles. You can also define password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            IAM roles allow AWS services like EC2 or Lambda to access resources without embedding access keys in your application. Best practices include using IAM roles, enabling MFA, and regularly rotating credentials for added security.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            IAM is an essential part of managing AWS security. By following best practices such as least privilege and policy simulation tools, you can effectively control and monitor user access in your AWS environment.

        <h2 class="post-title">What is Amazon EC2?</h2>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="post-summary">
            Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a scalable compute service that allows users to rent virtual servers in the cloud. It provides flexibility to scale compute resources up or down based on demand, offering a cost-effective solution for applications with variable workloads.
          </p>
          <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/4380/4380654.png" alt="What is Amazon EC2?" class="post-image">

        </div>
        <div class="full-content" hidden>
          <p>
            Key features include: On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances. EC2 offers flexibility in instance types, storage, networking, elastic load balancing, and auto-scaling to suit a variety of application needs.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            EC2 allows customized instance sizing and configuration. You can choose instance types based on application requirements, leverage Amazon EBS for persistent storage, and manage networking with VPCs and security groups. Auto scaling automatically adjusts instances to match demand.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            EC2 also supports bootstrapping, which runs user data scripts at the instance launch. This can automate tasks like software installations, downloading configuration files, and configuring system settings.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            EC2 offers a range of instance types for different workloads, such as General Purpose Instances, Compute Optimized Instances, Memory Optimized Instances, and Storage Optimized Instances. Each type provides specific resources like vCPUs, memory, network performance, and storage tailored to various application needs.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Instance types include: t4g.micro, m5.large, c5.large, r5.xlarge, i3.large, and more, each with varying levels of CPU, memory, storage, and network performance to meet specific use cases like web servers, databases, batch processing, and high-frequency trading.

        <h2 class="post-title">What’s an EBS Volume?</h2>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="post-summary">
            Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a network-attached storage for EC2 instances, providing persistent, block-level storage. It supports applications that require consistent, low-latency performance and allows data persistence even after instance termination.
          </p>
          <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/4240/4240927.png" alt="What’s an EBS Volume?" class="post-image">

          <button class="read-more-btn" aria-expanded="false">Read More</button>
        </div>
        <div class="full-content" hidden>
          <p>
            EBS volumes are automatically replicated within an Availability Zone (AZ) and come in several types, including General Purpose (gp3/gp2), Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2), Throughput Optimized (st1), and Cold (sc1). They can be attached to one EC2 instance at a time but can be detached and re-attached as needed.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The EBS delete on termination attribute controls whether the volume is automatically deleted when the associated EC2 instance is terminated. By default, the root volume is deleted, while additional volumes are not unless explicitly specified.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            EBS snapshots offer point-in-time backups of EBS volumes and are stored in Amazon S3. Snapshots are incremental, capturing only changes since the last backup. They can be copied across regions or accounts and automated using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            EBS snapshot archives are cheaper, providing a 75% reduction in cost. However, they take between 24 to 72 hours to restore. The EBS Snapshot Recycle Bin feature allows retention of deleted snapshots, offering recovery after accidental deletion with customizable retention periods.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Elastic File System (EFS) is a fully managed NFS solution for EC2 instances that can scale automatically and provides high availability across multiple Availability Zones. EFS can be accessed by hundreds of EC2 instances simultaneously, making it ideal for shared storage applications.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA) is a lower-cost storage class for infrequently accessed data, offering up to 92% savings compared to standard EFS. It automatically moves less-accessed files to the EFS-IA tier, while maintaining high availability.

        <h2 class="post-title">Scalability & High Availability</h2>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="post-summary">
            Scalability refers to a system's ability to handle increased load by adapting to demand, while High Availability ensures a system is operational for a high percentage of time by reducing failure impact. These concepts are essential for resilient cloud infrastructure.
          </p>
          <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/5372/5372011.png" alt="Scalability & High Availability" class="post-image">

          <button class="read-more-btn" aria-expanded="false">Read More</button>
        </div>
        <div class="full-content" hidden>
          <p>
            Scalability can be vertical (increasing a single instance's capacity) or horizontal (adding more instances to distribute the load). Vertical scalability is often used for databases, while horizontal scalability is suited for applications requiring resilience and distributed workloads.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            High Availability is achieved by deploying resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure failover and redundancy. It works best with horizontal scalability, as multiple AZs provide resilience against zone failures.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In EC2, vertical scaling involves increasing instance size, from smaller instances like t2.nano to larger ones like u-12tb1.metal. Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances using Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Scalability, Elasticity, and Agility each refer to different aspects of cloud infrastructure. Scalability adjusts capacity to handle varying traffic, elasticity dynamically adjusts resources in real-time, and agility enables quick deployment in response to demand changes.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple resources, preventing overloading any single resource. It improves fault tolerance, high availability, and provides features like SSL termination and health checks.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a managed service that distributes traffic across multiple targets in one or more AZs. ELB improves performance and scales with demand, with AWS handling upgrades and high availability.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Types of ELBs include Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic at Layer 7, Network Load Balancer (NLB) for high-performance traffic at Layer 4, and Classic Load Balancer (retiring) for both layers.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on metrics like CPU utilization, ensuring optimal capacity and high availability. It can automatically scale out (add instances) or scale in (remove instances) as needed, with cost savings from only running at optimal capacity.

        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="post-summary">
            Amazon S3 enables users to store objects in "buckets" (directories). Buckets must have unique names and are defined at the region level. S3 uses a global service model, but buckets are tied to specific regions.
          </p>
          <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/14354/14354523.png" alt="Amazon S3 Overview - Buckets" class="post-image">

        <div class="button-container">
          <button class="read-more-btn" aria-expanded="false">Read More</button>
        </div>
        <div class="full-content" hidden>
          <p>
            Buckets must follow naming conventions: no uppercase letters or underscores, 3-63 characters long, cannot be an IP, and must start with a lowercase letter or number.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Objects in S3 are identified by a "Key," which is the full path to the object. While S3 doesn’t have actual directories, the UI mimics a folder structure using slashes ("/") in the object keys.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The maximum object size in S3 is 5TB, but for uploads over 5GB, multi-part upload is required. Each object can have metadata and tags, and if versioning is enabled, a version ID is also included.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            S3 offers various security mechanisms, including user-based IAM policies and resource-based policies such as bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs). Encryption can also be applied to S3 objects.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Bucket policies are JSON-based and allow defining which actions are permitted or denied for specific resources. These policies can be used for public access management, cross-account access, and ensuring encryption during object uploads.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            For added security, you can configure "Block Public Access" settings to prevent unauthorized public access to your buckets and objects. These settings can be enforced at the account level.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            S3 can host static websites, making your content accessible via a specific URL. However, to avoid access issues, ensure that the bucket policy allows public reads if needed.

          <p class="post-summary">
            Storing data on disk (like EFS, EBS, EC2 Instance Store, or S3) has its limits. For more structured data storage, databases allow you to organize, query, and define relationships between datasets efficiently.
          </p>

          <p>
            Databases are designed for specific purposes and offer features like indexing, relationships, and query optimization. Managed databases in AWS take care of maintenance, backups, and security, reducing operational complexity.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Benefits of managed databases include high availability, disaster recovery, scalability, and enhanced security. AWS offers various database types such as Relational (SQL), NoSQL, Data Warehousing, and In-memory Caching.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Relational Databases (SQL) store structured data in predefined schema tables and are commonly used in transactional applications and financial systems. Popular examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            NoSQL databases offer flexibility with no predefined schema, making them ideal for real-time applications, IoT, and mobile apps. They scale out using distributed clusters and are optimized for specific data models. Examples include DynamoDB, MongoDB (DocumentDB), and various key-value, document, graph, and search databases.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            JSON is a common data format in NoSQL databases, supporting nested fields, dynamic structures, and new data types like arrays. An example of a NoSQL data entry might look like this:
            <pre>
              {
                "name": "Abc",
                "age": 30,
                "cars": ["Ford", "BMW", "Fiat"],
                "address": {
                  "type": "house",
                  "number": 23,
                  "street": "Abc Road"
                }
              }
            </pre>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            AWS operates with a shared responsibility model. AWS handles infrastructure management, backups, patches, and availability, while customers are responsible for data security, encryption, IAM access controls, monitoring, and performance tuning.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) is a fully managed service for relational databases, supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server. It automates provisioning, OS patching, backups, high availability, scaling, and more.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Key advantages of using RDS over deploying a database on EC2 include automated provisioning, continuous backups, monitoring dashboards, read replicas for improved performance, and Multi-AZ setups for disaster recovery. However, you cannot SSH into RDS instances.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            RDS offers different deployment options like Read Replicas (for scaling read workloads), Multi-AZ (for high availability with automatic failover), and Multi-Region (for disaster recovery and global availability).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In RDS, Read Replicas improve read performance and allow asynchronous replication, while Multi-AZ deployments provide failover and high availability, ensuring the database remains accessible in case of an AZ outage.

          <p>
            Docker containers provide consistency across different environments, allowing you to run the same application on any machine without compatibility issues. This leads to easier maintenance, faster scaling, and predictable behavior.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Docker works with any language, OS, or technology and enables rapid scaling of containers, with adjustments made in just seconds.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Docker images are stored in repositories like Docker Hub for public access, and Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for private storage, management, and deployment of container images.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Docker is often compared to Virtual Machines (VMs), but they are different. While both virtualize environments, Docker containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and portable. Virtual machines, on the other hand, include a full operating system, making them heavier and slower to start.

            Docker containers are best for modern, microservices-based applications, while virtual machines are better suited for running multiple OS environments.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a fully managed container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. ECS automates container management, allowing you to launch and manage Docker containers on AWS. ECS integrates with other AWS services like IAM, VPC, ELB, and ECR.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with ECS and EKS. It eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances, allowing you to pay for only the resources (CPU and memory) your containers use.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Amazon ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry that stores, manages, and secures Docker images. It integrates with ECS, EKS, and Fargate for seamless deployment and running of Docker containers.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Serverless computing eliminates the need to provision, scale, or manage servers. With serverless services like AWS Lambda, resources are automatically provisioned and scaled by AWS. Developers simply deploy functions (code) that respond to events, rather than managing infrastructure.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that executes code in response to events like API calls or file uploads. It automatically scales and only charges you for usage.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In contrast to EC2, where you manage virtual servers, AWS Lambda runs code in a serverless environment with no server management required. Lambda functions are limited by time, whereas EC2 instances are limited by RAM and CPU. Lambda scales automatically, unlike EC2, which requires manual intervention.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Benefits of AWS Lambda include automatic scaling based on event triggers, a pay-per-use pricing model, and a free tier that covers up to 1,000,000 requests and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time. Lambda also integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and supports multiple programming languages.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Lambda is ideal for event-driven architectures, with easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch and the ability to increase resources (up to 10GB of RAM) to boost performance.

        <h2 class="post-title">What is CloudFormation?</h2>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="post-summary">
            AWS CloudFormation is a declarative way to define and provision AWS infrastructure using code. You specify the resources you want, and CloudFormation takes care of creating them in the right order with the exact configuration.
          </p>
          <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/18510/18510693.png" alt="What is CloudFormation?" class="post-image">
        </div>
        <div class="button-container">
          <button class="read-more-btn" aria-expanded="false">Read More</button>
        </div>
        <div class="full-content" hidden>
          <p>
            CloudFormation allows you to declare your infrastructure using templates, specifying the resources you need (e.g., security groups, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, load balancers). It then creates, configures, and maintains the resources for you in the correct order.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The benefits of AWS CloudFormation include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Infrastructure as code</strong>: Resources are defined through code, improving control and eliminating manual configuration.</li>
              <li><strong>Cost management</strong>: Each resource within a CloudFormation stack is tagged, helping you track costs. You can also estimate costs through the template.</li>
              <li><strong>Productivity</strong>: CloudFormation allows you to destroy and recreate infrastructure quickly, automating diagram generation and eliminating the need for reinventing the wheel.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            CloudFormation supports almost all AWS resources, and if a resource isn't supported, you can use "custom resources" to define it. You can even leverage existing templates found on the web.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            For visual management, AWS CloudFormation Stack Designer allows you to see all resources in your stack and how they relate to each other. For example, a WordPress CloudFormation Stack would allow you to view all resources and their relationships.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) allows you to define your cloud infrastructure using a programming language you're familiar with, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, or .NET. The CDK compiles this code into a CloudFormation template, enabling you to deploy infrastructure and runtime code together.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Here’s an example using Python with the AWS CDK to create an S3 bucket with versioning enabled:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
      from aws_cdk import core
      from aws_cdk import aws_s3 as s3
      
      class MyS3BucketStack(core.Stack):
          def __init__(self, scope: core.Construct, id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
              super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)
      
              # Define an S3 bucket
              s3.Bucket(
                  self,
                  'MyS3Bucket',
                  versioned=True,
                  removal_policy=core.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
              )
      
      # App entry point
      app = core.App()
      MyS3BucketStack(app, 'MyS3BucketStack')
      app.synth()
            </code>
          </pre>
          <br>
          <p>
            After setting up the project and installing dependencies, running this script will create the S3 bucket as defined in the CDK stack.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Common developer challenges in AWS include managing infrastructure, deploying code, configuring databases, load balancers, and scaling. CloudFormation and CDK simplify these tasks by providing reusable templates and automating infrastructure provisioning.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Most web applications share similar architectures (such as an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Auto Scaling Group (ASG)). Developers are primarily focused on getting their code running consistently across different applications and environments, without the need to manage infrastructure manually.

        <div class="full-content" hidden>
          <h3>Amazon SQS - Simple Queue Service</h3>
          <p>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is AWS's oldest offering, providing a fully managed, serverless service for decoupling applications. SQS allows asynchronous message communication between components, making it highly scalable and reliable for distributed applications.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Decoupling of Applications</strong>: Send and receive messages asynchronously.</li>
            <li><strong>Queue Types</strong>: Standard queues (unlimited throughput) and FIFO queues (ordered processing).</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: From 1 message per second to 10,000+ messages per second.</li>
            <li><strong>Retention</strong>: Default message retention of 4 days, with a maximum of 14 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Latency</strong>: Less than 10ms for publishing and receiving messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Horizontal Scaling</strong>: Multiple consumers share the workload.</li>
            <li><strong>Message Deletion</strong>: Messages are deleted after they’re read by consumers.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
      
          <h3>Amazon Kinesis</h3>
          <p>Amazon Kinesis is a real-time big data streaming service that allows you to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale. It's mainly used for real-time data processing and analytics.</p>
          <p>While too detailed for the Cloud Practitioner exam, these components of Kinesis are important:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Kinesis Data Streams</strong>: Low-latency streaming to ingest data from thousands of sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Kinesis Data Firehose</strong>: Loads streams into S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Kinesis Data Analytics</strong>: Real-time analytics on streams using SQL.</li>
            <li><strong>Kinesis Video Streams</strong>: Monitor and analyze real-time video streams for applications like analytics or machine learning (ML).</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
      
          <h3>Amazon SNS - Simple Notification Service</h3>
          <p>Amazon SNS allows you to send notifications to multiple receivers. It's used for mass message delivery, primarily for mobile users, and provides low-cost infrastructure for event-driven systems.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Event Publishers</strong>: Only need to send messages to one SNS topic.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Subscribers</strong>: Multiple subscribers can listen to the SNS topic and receive all messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic, with a limit of 100,000 topics.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
      
          <h3>Amazon MQ</h3>
          <p>Amazon MQ is a managed Apache ActiveMQ service, designed to support legacy protocols like MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, and WSS. It's particularly useful when migrating traditional on-premise applications to the cloud, offering a way to integrate without re-engineering applications for cloud-native services like SQS and SNS.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Managed ActiveMQ</strong>: Amazon MQ is a managed service for applications that use open protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Queue & Topic Support</strong>: Similar to SQS and SNS, but with traditional message broker support.</li>
            <li><strong>Not Serverless</strong>: Runs on dedicated machines, not serverless like SQS and SNS.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="post-summary">
            Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) allows you to create a private network for your AWS resources. Within the VPC, you can define subnets, control internet access, and set up secure connections to other VPCs, on-premises environments, and AWS services.
          </p>

          <h3>Amazon VPC</h3>
          <p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private network within AWS that you can use to host your resources. VPCs are region-specific and consist of subnets, which allow you to partition your network based on availability zones.</p>
      
          <h4>Subnets</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Subnet:</strong> A subnet that is accessible from the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Subnet:</strong> A subnet that is not accessible from the internet.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h3>Routing Access with Route Tables</h3>
          <p>Route tables control the flow of traffic within your VPC. They define how traffic is routed between subnets and to/from the internet.</p>
      
          <h3>Internet Gateway (IGW)</h3>
          <p>The Internet Gateway connects your VPC to the internet, allowing instances in your VPC to communicate directly with the internet.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Essential for enabling public subnet communication with the internet.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h3>NAT Gateway</h3>
          <p>The NAT Gateway allows instances in private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing unsolicited inbound traffic.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Used for scenarios like downloading updates and patches while preventing direct access from the internet.</li>
            <li>Managed by AWS for ease of use and scalability.</li>

            <h3>AWS Organizations</h3>
            <p>AWS Organizations is a global service that allows you to manage multiple AWS accounts. The main account in the organization is the master account, which oversees all billing and access controls for the organization.</p>
            
            <h4>Cost Benefits</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Consolidated billing across all accounts, simplifying the payment process.</li>
                <li>Volume-based pricing benefits, such as discounts for EC2, S3, and other services due to aggregated usage.</li>
                <li>Pooling of Reserved EC2 instances for optimal savings.</li>
                <li>API available for automating AWS account creation.</li>
                <li>Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies (SCP).</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Multi-Account Strategies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Create accounts per department, cost center, or environment (dev, test, prod) for better resource isolation.</li>
                <li>Use SCPs to enforce compliance or regulatory restrictions.</li>
                <li>Enable centralized logging by sending CloudTrail and CloudWatch logs to a central account.</li>
                <li>Utilize tagging standards for billing purposes and separate per-account service limits.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Service Control Policies (SCP)</h3>
            <p>SCPs allow you to whitelist or blacklist IAM actions at the organizational unit (OU) or account level, except for the master account. They do not affect service-linked roles, which are essential for AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SCP must have an explicit "Allow" to permit access (by default, they do not allow anything).</li>
                <li>Common use cases: restricting access to certain services, enforcing PCI compliance by disabling services, etc.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>AWS Control Tower</h3>
            <p>AWS Control Tower helps you set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment following AWS best practices. It runs on top of AWS Organizations and automates ongoing policy management, detecting violations and monitoring compliance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automate environment setup in a few clicks.</li>
                <li>Use "guardrails" for policy enforcement and remediation.</li>
                <li>Monitor compliance through an interactive dashboard.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM)</h3>
            <p>AWS RAM allows you to share AWS resources that you own with other AWS accounts, either within your organization or externally. This helps avoid resource duplication and can save costs across multiple accounts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resources supported for sharing include VPC subnets, Transit Gateway, Aurora, EC2 Dedicated Hosts, Route 53, etc.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>AWS Service Catalog</h3>
            <p>AWS Service Catalog provides a curated, self-service portal for launching AWS resources. It helps ensure that users follow governance policies and only deploy approved resources, reducing the risk of non-compliant or rogue stacks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can launch predefined sets of authorized products, such as virtual machines, databases, and storage options.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Pricing Models in AWS</h3>
            <p>AWS offers four primary pricing models to cater to different business needs and optimize cost savings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pay as you go:</strong> Pay only for what you use, offering agility and scalability.</li>
                <li><strong>Save when you reserve:</strong> Reduce costs with reserved capacity for EC2, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, RDS, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Pay less by using more:</strong> Receive volume-based discounts for higher usage levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Pay less as AWS grows:</strong> Benefit from cost reductions as AWS scales its services.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>EC2 Pricing</h3>
            <p>The EC2 pricing model offers several options based on your needs:</p>
            <h4>On-Demand Instances</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pay for the compute capacity by the second or hour (Linux/Windows).</li>
                <li>Flexible, pay for what you use without long-term commitments.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Reserved Instances</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Save up to 75% compared to on-demand pricing.</li>
                <li>Commit to a 1- or 3-year term, with various payment options: all upfront, partial upfront, or no upfront.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Spot Instances</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bid for unused EC2 capacity and save up to 90% off on-demand pricing.</li>
                <li>Best for workloads that can tolerate interruptions.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Dedicated Hosts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>On-demand or reserved (1 or 3 years).</li>
                <li>Reserved instances also available to save on sustained usage.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h4>Savings Plans</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Alternative to Reserved Instances, offering flexible savings for EC2 and Fargate workloads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Well-Architected Framework General Guiding Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stop guessing capacity needs:</strong> Use automated tools and scaling to avoid over-provisioning.</li>
                <li><strong>Test systems at production scale:</strong> Simulate real-world load and usage patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Automate to facilitate architectural experimentation:</strong> Make testing and evolving architectures fast and efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Allow for evolutionary architectures:</strong> Continuously adapt to changing requirements and scale as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Drive architectures using data:</strong> Use data-driven decisions for continuous improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve through game days:</strong> Simulate high-stress events like flash sales to test system robustness.</li>
