<ul>
  <li>VPC -Virtual Private Cloud: private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)</li>
  <li>Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)</li>
  <li>A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet</li>
  <li>A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet</li>
  <li>To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="internet-gateway-igw">Internet Gateway (IGW)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Connects a VPC to the internet.</li>
  <li>Allows instances in the VPC to directly communicate with the internet.</li>
  <li>Essential for a public subnet in a VPC to send/receive traffic to/from the internet.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nat-gateway">NAT Gateway</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Allows instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet.</li>
  <li>Prevents unsolicited inbound traffic from reaching those instances.</li>
  <li>Used for scenarios where instances need to download patches, updates, etc., but should not be directly accessed from the internet.</li>
  <li>Managed by AWS</li>
